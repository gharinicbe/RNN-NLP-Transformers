NLP Concepts and Chatbot using Transformers
This repository contains educational materials and code examples for understanding fundamental concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and hands-on practice using Python's TextBlob library. Additionally, it provides a Python program showcasing the creation of a chatbot using the Microsoft DialoGPT transformer model. The chatbot is trained on a dataset comprising conversations from REDDIT over a specific period. The repository aims to cover various aspects of NLP, from basic text data cleaning to advanced feature extraction techniques.

Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. This repository provides resources to help you understand key concepts in NLP, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, text data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, stemming), and advanced feature extraction methods like Word2Vec and TF-IDF.

NLP Concepts Covered
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Understand how RNNs can model sequential data, making them suitable for tasks like text generation, sentiment analysis, and more.

Transformers: Learn about the revolutionary Transformers architecture, which powers various state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT, GPT, and more.

Python TextBlob for NLP Basics
Python's TextBlob library offers a user-friendly interface for common NLP tasks, such as text cleaning (stopword and punctuation removal), tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming. Jupyter notebooks in the repository demonstrate the practical implementation of these techniques.

Chatbot using Microsoft DialoGPT
Explore a hands-on example of building a chatbot using the Microsoft DialoGPT transformer model. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset consisting of conversations from REDDIT to generate human-like responses in a conversational context.

Usage
To benefit from this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Explore the Jupyter notebooks for TextBlob NLP basics and chatbot creation.
Experiment with different settings and variations of the provided code.
Customize the chatbot's as required.
